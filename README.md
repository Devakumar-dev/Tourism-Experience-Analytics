# Tourism-Experience-Analytics
This project builds a personalized tourism recommendation system using both collaborative filtering (based on user behavior) and content-based filtering (based on attraction type and location). It predicts user preferences and suggests suitable attractions, accommodations, or activities to enhance their travel experience.
